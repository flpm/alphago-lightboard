# alphago-lightboard
Test lightboard components using AlphaGo and Master games

This is a very rough and basic test of the React components I am currently working on. Eventually these components will be released separately.

To run the test app locally on your computer, install git, Node.js and npm and then:

1. Clone the repository (or download the code)
2. run `npm install` inside the folder
3. run `npm start` to run a local version and open it a browser window (or browse to http://localhost:3000/)
